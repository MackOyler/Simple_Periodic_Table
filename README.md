# Simple Periodic Table

Welcome to the Simple Periodic Table project. This program provides information about elements in the periodic table. Currently, it supports searching elements by their atomic number and provides details such as name, symbol, atomic number, electronic configuration, discovery information, and typical charge.

## Features

- Search elements by atomic number.
- Displays detailed information for each element.

## Elements Included

As of now, the program only includes information for the following elements:

1. **Hydrogen**
    - **Symbol:** H
    - **Atomic Number:** 1
    - **Electronic Configuration:** 1s^1
    - **Discovered By:** Henry Cavendish
    - **Charge:** +1

2. **Helium**
    - **Symbol:** He
    - **Atomic Number:** 2
    - **Electronic Configuration:** 1s^2
    - **Discovered By:** Pierre Janssen
    - **Charge:** 0

3. **Lithium**
    - **Symbol:** Li
    - **Atomic Number:** 3
    - **Electronic Configuration:** [He] 2s^1
    - **Discovered By:** Johann August Arfvedson
    - **Charge:** +1

4. **Beryllium**
    - **Symbol:** Be
    - **Atomic Number:** 4
    - **Electronic Configuration:** [He] 2s^2
    - **Discovered By:** Louis Nicolas Vauquelin
    - **Charge:** +2

## Future Updates

- Adding more elements to the periodic table.
- Improving the user interface and search functionality.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter `1` to search for an element by its atomic number.
3. Enter the atomic number of the element you wish to learn about.
4. The program will display the element's details if available.
5. Enter `2` to close the periodic table.
